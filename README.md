## Abstract

In this paper, we present a novel neural network using multi scale feature fusion
at various scales for accurate and efficient semantic image segmentation. We
used ResNet based feature extractor, dilated convolutional layers in downsampling
part, atrous convolutional layers in the upsampling part and used concat operation
to merge them. A new attention module is proposed to encode more contextual
information and enhance the receptive field of the network. We present an in depth
theoretical analysis of our network with training and optimization details. Our
network was trained and tested on the Camvid dataset and Cityscapes dataset using
mean accuracy per class and Intersection Over Union (IOU) as the evaluation
metrics. Our model outperforms previous state of the art methods on semantic
segmentation achieving mean IOU value of 74.12 while running at >100 FPS.

## Data

1. `Camvid dataset`: The Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid) is a collection of
videos with object class semantic labels, complete with metadata. The database provides ground truth
labels that associate each pixel with one of 32 classes. The images are of size 360×480. The original
images are taken as ground truth. For any algorithm, the metrics are always evaluated in comparison
to the ground truth data. The ground truth information is provided in the dataset for the training and
test set.

2. `Cityscapes dataset`: This dataset contains urban street scenes images from 50 different cities. The
images are divided into 5,000 finely annotated images and 19,998 coarsely annotated images. The
total number of classes in the dataset is 30, but we have only used 19 classes for both training and
evaluation. The images in training, validation and test set are 2,975, 500, 1,525 respectively.

## Network Architecture

## Usage

Training: `python train.py`

Testing: `python test.py`

Testing on a single image: `python predict.py`

## Evaluation Metrics

1. `Mean Accuracy per-class` - This metric outputs the class wise prediction accuracy per pixel.

2. `Mean IOU` - It is a segmentation performance parameter that measures the overlap between two
objects by calculating the ratio of intersection and union with ground truth masks. This metric is also
known as Jaccard Index.
